Prosper:

First Modern peer-to-peer lending marketplace that tries to match borrower and lenders.

Prosper has a non-traditional loan model with several key advantages over traditional banks. 
The E-business commerce setup reduces fixed costs borne by physical infrastructure (e.g. bank branches) and automation, databases, software and technology improve and expedite the borrowing and loaning experience.
The loans are unsecured, in that there is no collateral a borrower needs to put up, that could get taken away in lieu of payments.
There are multiple people investing in an amount for one person that needs a loan.

In the last few years, with the advent of peer-to-peer markets and of fintech companies that try to disrupt the banking ecosystem,
there has been one major issue that is still yet to be resolved by these new players: Interest rates have been quite signifcantly expensive than
what major banks offer. The reason why Propser and similar peer-to-peer online marketplaces increase interest rates is primarily due to the signifcant default rates they would encounter.

In this analysis, I try to explore good loans and defaulted loans, and the reasons to why a loan is defaulted when another is not.
